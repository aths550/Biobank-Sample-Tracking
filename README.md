# Biobank Sample Tracking System

## Description

The Biobank Sample Tracking System is a blockchain-based smart contract built on the Move programming language that provides secure, transparent, and immutable tracking of biological samples with donor consent management. This system ensures that biological samples are properly registered with explicit donor consent and provides mechanisms to verify consent status before any sample operations.

The contract implements a decentralized approach to biobanking, where each sample is uniquely identified and linked to its donor's address, with consent status permanently recorded on the blockchain. This creates an auditable trail for compliance with medical research regulations and ethical standards.

## Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize biobanking and medical research by creating a trustless, transparent, and globally accessible system for biological sample management. We aim to:

- **Enhance Trust**: Build confidence between donors, researchers, and institutions through blockchain transparency
- **Ensure Compliance**: Provide immutable consent records that meet international medical research standards
- **Democratize Research**: Enable global collaboration in medical research while protecting donor rights
- **Reduce Bureaucracy**: Streamline sample tracking and consent verification processes
- **Empower Donors**: Give donors complete control and visibility over their biological samples

## Future Scope

### Phase 1: Enhanced Sample Management
- **Sample Metadata**: Add support for sample type, collection date, storage location, and expiration tracking
- **Batch Operations**: Enable bulk sample registration and consent management
- **Sample Lifecycle**: Track sample states (collected, processed, analyzed, disposed)

### Phase 2: Advanced Consent Management
- **Granular Consent**: Implement consent for specific research areas or types of studies
- **Consent Withdrawal**: Allow donors to revoke consent and trigger sample destruction protocols
- **Time-bound Consent**: Enable temporary consent with automatic expiration
- **Consent Templates**: Support different consent types for various research categories

### Phase 3: Research Integration
- **Research Requests**: Allow researchers to request access to samples based on criteria
- **Smart Matching**: Automatically match research needs with available consented samples
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitor how samples are being used in research
- **Results Sharing**: Enable researchers to share findings back with donors (if consented)

### Phase 4: Ecosystem Expansion
- **Multi-institution Support**: Enable sample sharing across multiple biobanks
- **Regulatory Integration**: Connect with national and international regulatory bodies
- **Mobile Application**: Develop user-friendly mobile apps for donors and researchers
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Provide insights and reporting tools for biobank administrators

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- **AI Integration**: Implement machine learning for sample quality prediction and research optimization
- **IoT Integration**: Connect with IoT sensors for real-time sample storage monitoring
- **Decentralized Identity**: Integrate with decentralized identity solutions for enhanced privacy
- **Cross-chain Compatibility**: Enable interoperability with other blockchain networks
